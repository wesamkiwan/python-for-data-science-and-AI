# Progress Tracker: Python for Data Science & AI

This file tracks two separate things — don't confuse them:

1. **Content Status** (right-most column) — whether the material for a module has been *written* yet. This is informational only; you don't edit it.
2. **Your checkboxes** (Learning / Exercise / Cheat Sheet / Interview / References) — these are **for you, the learner**, to check off yourself as you actually work through each piece. They start empty and stay empty until you do the work — nobody pre-fills these for you.

**Content Available:** 8/20 modules written (40%)
**Your Progress:** 0/20 modules complete (0%) — check boxes below as you go!

## 🛠️ Course-Author Log (for resuming content creation — not a learner section)

👉 **Content written through:** Module 08 — Data Cleaning & Wrangling (Phase 2: Data Science Core)
👉 **Next to write:** Module 09 — Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

**Resume instructions for next authoring session:** Module 08 is fully written (3 learning files — `01-missing-data.md`, `02-duplicates-and-dtypes.md`, `03-string-cleaning-and-outliers.md` — + cheatsheet + interview + references, all committed and pushed to GitHub; every code example was executed against pandas 3.0.x and verified — note pandas 3.0's `.unique()` on a string column now returns an `ArrowStringArray` with a multi-line repr rather than a plain array, called out where relevant). **IMPORTANT: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` are NOT YET INSTALLED in this environment** — run `pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly` before writing/testing Module 09's code examples. Write Module 09 next in `phase2-data-science-core/module09-data-visualization/`: cover Matplotlib fundamentals (figure/axes, line/bar/scatter/histogram plots, labels/titles/legends, subplots), Seaborn for statistical plots (built on Matplotlib — distribution plots, box plots tying back to Module 08's IQR outlier method, heatmaps, pairplots), and a lighter intro to Plotly for interactive charts. Given the 4h estimate and three distinct libraries, likely 3 learning files (one per library) makes sense, each showing when to reach for that specific tool (quick/simple → Matplotlib; statistical/exploratory → Seaborn; interactive/dashboard-ready → Plotly). Since chart images can't be verified by reading printed text output the way prior modules' code was, run each plotting example with `plt.savefig(...)` (or equivalent) to confirm it executes without error, and describe expected visual output in words rather than fabricating exact pixel-level descriptions. Build learning file(s) → cheatsheet → interview prep → references → update this module's row to "📗 Content ready" (leave the learner checkboxes empty!) → commit + push → move the two pointers above to Module 10.

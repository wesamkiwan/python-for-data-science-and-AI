# Progress Tracker: Python for Data Science & AI

This file tracks two separate things — don't confuse them:

1. **Content Status** (right-most column) — whether the material for a module has been *written* yet. This is informational only; you don't edit it.
2. **Your checkboxes** (Learning / Exercise / Cheat Sheet / Interview / References) — these are **for you, the learner**, to check off yourself as you actually work through each piece. They start empty and stay empty until you do the work — nobody pre-fills these for you.

**Content Available:** 13/20 modules written (65%)
**Your Progress:** 0/20 modules complete (0%) — check boxes below as you go!

## 🛠️ Course-Author Log (for resuming content creation — not a learner section)

👉 **Content written through:** Module 13 — Feature Engineering & Model Evaluation (Phase 3: Machine Learning)
👉 **Next to write:** Module 14 — Unsupervised Learning & Clustering

**Resume instructions for next authoring session:** Module 13 is fully written (3 learning files — `01-scaling-and-encoding.md`, `02-pipelines-and-data-leakage.md`, `03-cross-validation-and-overfitting.md` — + cheatsheet + interview + references, all committed and pushed to GitHub; every example executed against scikit-learn 1.9.0 and verified, including confirming that wrapping Module 12b's unscaled Wine `LogisticRegression` in a `Pipeline` with `StandardScaler` both eliminates the `ConvergenceWarning` AND improves accuracy from 0.9556 to a perfect 1.0000 — closing that loop concretely; also verified a synthetic `make_classification` dataset that cleanly demonstrates overfitting (test accuracy peaks at low tree depth then degrades as depth increases, unlike the too-easy Wine/Iris datasets). Write Module 14 next in `phase3-machine-learning/module14-unsupervised-learning/` (folder confirmed empty): cover unsupervised learning's core distinction from Phase 3 so far (no target/labels — tie back explicitly to Module 12a's features/target framing), K-Means clustering (`sklearn.cluster.KMeans`, the elbow method for choosing k, visualizing clusters with Module 09's Matplotlib/Seaborn skills), hierarchical clustering (dendrograms) at a lighter/conceptual level, PCA for dimensionality reduction (`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`, tie back to Module 06's reshaping/Module 10's variance concepts), and a brief note on clustering evaluation (silhouette score) since there's no accuracy/R² without ground-truth labels. Given the 3h estimate, likely 2-3 learning files. Build learning file(s) → cheatsheet → interview prep → references → update this module's row to "📗 Content ready" (leave the learner checkboxes empty!) → commit + push → move the two pointers above to Module 15.
